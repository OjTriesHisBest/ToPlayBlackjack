# ToPlayBlackjack

The aim of this project was to create a simple, text based, game of Blackjack. 

It wasn't simple. It took be a long time and showed me that capital letters matter as they often slowed down my debugging process. However, the game works well enough. I just 
couldn't figure out how to turn it into a round based game. I likely would have to attach the money to players rather than have them as their own object. But I wanted to move on. 

Suggestions welcome. That is, if anyone ever reads this.

PS this is written in Jupyter - it can be converted into a python script but I don't want to do that right now.
